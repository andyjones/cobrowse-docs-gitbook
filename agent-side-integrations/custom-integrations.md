# Custom integrations

Rather than accessing Cobrowse.io via our website, many of our customers integrate the agent-side UI directly into their own applications. 

We provide a variety of resources to make this as easy as possible, including:

* [Agent JS API](agent-sdk.md) \(client-side JavaScript SDK\)
* [Agent UI component library](agent-sdk.md) \(written in React\)
* [Authentication \(JWTs\) ](json-web-tokens-jwts.md) \(automatic authentication and permission scoping\)
* [IFrame embeds](custom-iframe-embeds.md) \(eg. to embed the entire Cobrowse.io dashboard\)

Using a combination of these resources, Cobrowse.io can be seamlessly integrated as a white-labeled feature into your own products and services. 

After your initial Cobrowse account setup, there's no need to register each individual user to your Cobrowse account - this is all done automatically through use of [JWTs](json-web-tokens-jwts.md).
