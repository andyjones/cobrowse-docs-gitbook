## Overview

{% hint style="warning" %}
Installing our Zendesk apps using the marketplace links below will automatically create a new Cobrowse account linked to your Zendesk organization, and a new license key. If you've already created an account separately, you may switch between your multiple accounts by clicking your avatar from the dashboard.
{% endhint %}

Cobrowse.io provides an integration with both Zendesk Support and Zendesk Chat available in the Zendesk App Marketplace.

### Demo videos

Demo video: [https://vimeo.com/922548750](https://vimeo.com/922548750).

### Zendesk Requirements

You must have an active trial/subscription with Zendesk Support (even to use our App with Zendesk Chat). This is a requirement from Zendesk to use their secure authentication that is not available for Apps on Chat-only accounts.

### Zendesk App Marketplace links

Newer accounts will only need to install the Cobrowse.io for Support app, it is  100% compatible with Zendesk Messaging and the new Sunshine Conversations widget.

If you are using the Legacy Zendesk Chat you will also need to install the Cobrowse.io for Chat app.
