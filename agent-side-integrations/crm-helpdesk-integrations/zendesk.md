You must install our Zendesk apps using the marketplace links below in order for your Cobrowse.io account to be linked to your Zendesk organization. Do not sign up via our website first, as this will create an unlinked account!

### Zendesk Requirements

You must have an active trial/subscription with Zendesk Support (even to use our App with Zendesk Chat). This is a requirement from Zendesk to use their secure authentication that is not available for Apps on Chat-only accounts.
