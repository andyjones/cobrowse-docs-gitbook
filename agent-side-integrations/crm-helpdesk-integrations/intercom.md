# Intercom

## Overview

Cobrowse.io provides an integration with Intercom available in the Intercom App Marketplace. Get started here [https://cobrowse.io/intercom](https://cobrowse.io/intercom)

## Troubleshooting

#### I can connect from https://cobrowse.io/dashboard, but not from within Intercom.

It's likely your Intercom account is linked to a separate Cobrowse.io account. When you install Cobrowse.io for Intercom, a new license key is generated for you. This may be different from an existing license key you are using when you signed up directly at [https://cobrowse.io/register](https://cobrowse.io/register). 

#### No devices found for user, cannot start cobrowse session.

Please ensure Cobrowse.io Javascript Snippet has been added to your website where you are using Intercom chat. Installation instructions at [Web SDK](../../sdk-installation/web.md).
