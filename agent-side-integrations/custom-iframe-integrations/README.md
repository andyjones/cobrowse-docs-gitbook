# Custom iFrame integrations

If your helpdesk is not listed, or you'd like to integrate Cobrowse with any other web-based application or tool, we provide a flexible integration model using IFrames and JSON Web Tokens \(JWTs\) for authentication.

After your initial Cobrowse account setup, there's no need to register each individual user to your Cobrowse account - this is all done automatically through use of JWTs.
