# Custom integrations

Rather than accessing Cobrowse.io via our website, many of our customers integrate the agent-side UI directly into their own applications. 

We provide a variety of resources to make this as easy as possible, including:

* [Agent API](agent-api.md) \(client-side JavaScript SDK\)
* [Examples of customizable UI components](agent-api.md) \(written in React, more frameworks coming soon\)
* [iFrames](custom-iframe-integrations.md) \(to easily drop the entire Cobrowse.io dashboard into your own website\)
* [JSON Web Tokens](json-web-tokens-jwts.md) \(used for automatic authentication and permission scoping\)

Using a combination of these resources, Cobrowse.io can be seamlessly integrated as a white-labeled feature into your own products and tools. 

After your initial Cobrowse account setup, there's no need to register each individual user to your Cobrowse account - this is all done automatically through use of JWTs.
