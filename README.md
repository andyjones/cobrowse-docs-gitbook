# Getting started

To use Cobrowse in your own app or website, you'll need to add the Cobrowse.io SDK for each platform you want to support. We've made this as simple as possible, with just a few lines of code.

Once each SDK is added to your app, authenticated agents can connect to user devices entirely through their web browser - no installs or plugins needed. Cobrowse also integrates seamlessly with tools like Intercom, Zendesk, Salesforce, Genesys, or Freshdesk, or with your own custom CRM using IFrames.
