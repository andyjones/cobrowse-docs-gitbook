# Redact sensitive data

When remotely viewing a user's screen, there may be certain sensitive data that should not be viewable by the agent.

For this purpose, we provide a redaction API that automatically blurs on device all sensitive data sources such as credit cards, social security numbers, etc. When certain data is redacted, it will never leave the user's device.
