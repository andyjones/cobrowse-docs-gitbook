# Full device capabilities

Cobrowse has been designed to be private, as such our screen sharing session are restricted by default to the app or website your are integrating our SDKs in to. If you wish, you can allow your support agents to upgrade these app-only sessions to allow screen sharing from the entire device, for example to capture other apps and settings on their phone, or the entire screen of their computer.

### Full device options

Full device screen share is supported on iOS, Android, MacOS, Windows, and through our web SDK. See these docs for how to set up full device screen sharing in your app:

{% content-ref url="full-device-screen-sharing.md" %}
[full-device-screen-sharing.md](full-device-screen-sharing.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

&#x20;Where the underlying platform allows we also support full device remote control, allowing you to take complete control of a remote device to assist your users even with the most complex issues outside your app. See these docs for supported platforms and setup instructions:

{% content-ref url="full-device-remote-control.md" %}
[full-device-remote-control.md](full-device-remote-control.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
