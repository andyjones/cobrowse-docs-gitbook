# Alternate render method

A small number of iOS apps, usually with highly customized controls and lots of animation, can benefit from an alternate render method used by the Cobrowse.io iOS SDK.

You may test this alternate render method by adding a plist entry to your Info.plist as follows:

```markup
<key>CBIORenderMethod</key>
<integer>2</integer>
```

If you've been able to test this alternate render method in your iOS app, we would love to hear your feedback. Please drop us an email at [hello@cobrowse.io](mailto:hello@cobrowse.io).
