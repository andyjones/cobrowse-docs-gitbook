# Customize the interface

Cobrowse.io provides some minimal default UI in the SDKs for things like user consent and to visually indicate when a session is active.

Many customers are happy to use our default UI which works out of box. This is a great way to get started. But if you prefer, everything is easily customizable to meet your specific requirements.

{% page-ref page="session-indicator.md" %}

{% page-ref page="require-acceptance-from-user.md" %}

{% page-ref page="6-digit-code-screen.md" %}
