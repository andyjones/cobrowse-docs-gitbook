# Pin web SDK version

Our Web SDK receives regular updates, these are always published to the hosted version of SDK. Some customers may prefer to pin the version of the SDK to one shipped and tested with their Cobrowse Enterprise deployment for stability and reproducibility.

#### Pin the web SDK version

The web SDK is hosted on your deployment at `/sdk-js/CobrowseIO.js`

You can use our snippet found on the [Web SDK](../../sdk-installation/web.md#installation) installation page, but replace the `src` that is set to `https://js.cobrowse.io/CobrowseIO.js` with your own deployment URL.
