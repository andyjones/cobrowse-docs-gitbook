If you are hosting Cobrowse Enterprise in AWS, then metrics are automatically exported into CloudWatch natively without extra effort.

Please refer to your AWS CloudWatch dashboards for all supported Cobrowse application metrics.

{% hint style="info" %}
For AWS deployments, access to Redis metrics through OpenMetrics is not supported. Instead, please refer to your AWS Elasticache resources in CloudWatch for all available monitoring metrics.
